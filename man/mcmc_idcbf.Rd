\arguments{
\item{sample_cov_list}{A list of length \code{L} (number of groups), where each element is the sample covariance matrix for a group.}

\item{ns}{A vector of sample sizes for each group. If not provided, the function assumes it is embedded in \code{prior_params}.}

\item{method}{Graphical model type. Currently only \code{"ggm"} is supported.}

\item{algorithm}{Graph estimation algorithm. Currently only \code{"ggmdcbf"} is supported.}

\item{iter}{Total number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{burnin}{Number of initial iterations to discard (burn-in period).}

\item{prior}{A function to sample an initial graph from the prior.}

\item{prior_params}{Parameters passed to the \code{prior} function.}

\item{prior_ratio}{A function returning the prior ratio between two graphs.}

\item{df_prior}{Degrees of freedom for the G-Wishart prior (must be >= 3).}

\item{identifiable}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, ensures that sampled graphs are identifiable.}

\item{fast}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, expects \code{num_edges_sample} to control sampling efficiency.}

\item{num_edges_sample}{Optional. Number of edges to sample per iteration if \code{fast = TRUE}.}

\item{nu}{Optional hyperparameter passed to DCBF inner sampler.}

\item{theta}{Optional hyperparameter passed to DCBF inner sampler.}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{iter - burnin}, where each element is itself a list of length \code{L} containing the sampled graph and precision matrix for each group.
}
\description{
This function runs a MCMC multi-group version of the Identifiable Direct Double Conditional Bayes Factor (IDCBF) sampler
for Gaussian Graphical Models. It is based on the DCBF algorithm from Hinne et. al.
